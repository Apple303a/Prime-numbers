# Prime-numbers
Enter a number and you will get all the prime numbers smaller than the given number.

I checked the efficiency off the code by removing the break in line 24 and plotting a graph for the time taken and the entered number. 
Then I plotted a graph for the same by using break. Here are the results:-

time taken (with break)	    time taken (without break)	   number
22	                        26	                           10000
105	                        177	                           100000
2944	                      5982	                         1000000
8356	                      16154	                         2000000
16747	                      26490	                         3000000
24583	                      43498	                         4000000
30879	                      51655	                         4500000
39965	                      66523	                         5000000
73289	                      107485	                       7500000
125907	                    186534	                       10000000
