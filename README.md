# Prime-numbers
Enter a number and you will get all the prime numbers smaller than the given number.

I checked the efficiency off the code by removing the break in line 24 and plotting a graph for the time taken and the entered number. 
Then I plotted a graph for the same by using break. The difference was quite significant when the numbers where larger.
